# Modelling-Airborne-Transmission

C-contour.py: produces a contour plot for the concentration in a room at a chosen time.

C-point.py: For a chosen point in the room, produces a concentration versus time graph.

Prob-contour.py: produces a contour plot for the probability of infection in a room at a chosen time.

Prob-point.py: For a chosen point in the room, produces a probability versus time graph.

avg-Prob.py: Plots the spatially-average probability of infection in a room versus time.

TTPI-contour.py: produces a contour plot for the Time to Probable Infection (TTPI) in a room.

TTPI-vs-lambda.py: For a chosen point in the room, produces a TTPI versus Air exchange rate graph. 

TTPI-vs-R.py: For a chosen point in the room, produces a log-log plot of TTPI versus R (the particle emission rate).
